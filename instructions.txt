Create a simple memory manager in Java or C.

should run 3 algorithms:
1. first fit
2. best fit
3. worst fit


program takes a file as input (command line arguments). The file is in this format:

1st line: number between 1 and 3, representing 1 = first fit, 2 = best fit, 3 = worst fit
2nd line: total size of memory in KBs
All other lines in one of these formats:
		option 1) A PID MEMORY_SIZE
		option 2) D PID
		option 3) P
		
	option 1 - allocate a memory with id PID, that's size MEMORY_SIZE. Unit would be in KBs.
	option 2 - deallocate memory for process with id PID
	option 3 - print out current state of memory (allocations and free spaces)
	
	
Sample file:


2
16384
A 1 210
A 2 1450
A 3 8000
D 2
P
A 2 900
D 1
D 3
A 4 800
P
